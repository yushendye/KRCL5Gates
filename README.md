<h2> Automatic Gate Monitoring Sysyem </h2>

<p>
This project was originally intended to be used by Konkan Railway Coroporation Limited. This project is based on
              	IOT and android. In this project I have used arduino UNO board with HC-05 bluetooth module as a hardware component. This system was designed to automate the task of generation of private number (PN) by station master and the gateman. <br> Working: <br> 1. The station master sees the 
              	coming train and uses this application to generate a private number by entering train number and sends it to the gateman<br> 2. Gateman
              	receives the number generated by station master. Now gateman closes the gate and makes sure no vehicle passes the rail track until the train
              	is passed. <br> Then only after he has closed the gate, now he can generate acknowledge the number sent by station master and generate his
              	own private number. <br> 4. Once the train passes the gate, gateman now opens the gate, and the he enters the time at which train has passed
              	and commits the communication
</p>

  This repository is for the station master application. This repository covers the code implementation for station master only. The repository for gateman can be found
